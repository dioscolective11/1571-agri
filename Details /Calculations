A general water balance equation is:[5]

P = Q + ET + ΔS
where

P is precipitation
Q is streamflow
ET is evapotranspiration
ΔS is the change in storage (in soil or the bedrock / groundwater)
This equation uses the principles of conservation of mass in a closed system, whereby any water entering a system (via precipitation), must be transferred into either evaporation, transpiration, surface runoff (eventually reaching the channel and leaving in the form of river discharge), or stored in the ground. This equation requires the system to be closed, and where it is not (for example when surface runoff contributes to a different basin), this must be taken into account.

Extensive water balances are discussed in agricultural hydrology.

A water balance can be used to help manage water supply and predict where there may be water shortages. It is also used in irrigation, runoff assessment (e.g. through the RainOff model [6]), flood control and pollution control. Further it is used in the design of subsurface drainage systems which may be horizontal (i.e. using pipes, tile drains or ditches) or vertical (drainage by wells).[7] To estimate the drainage requirement, the use of a hydrogeological water balance and a groundwater model (e.g. SahysMod[8]) may be instrumental.

The water balance can be illustrated using a water balance graph which plots levels of precipitation and evapotranspiration often on a monthly scale.

VA+OS+PP=ET+NR+RF+RP

storage of an urban area is negligible, water balance equation becomes

 VA_{riv}+OS_{gw}=NR+RF_{wwtp}+RP_{leak}+RP
