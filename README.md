The project is the solution to the SIH problem 1571 “Drone-based Intelligent ET sensing system and irrigation water use accounting system for irrigation commands.”  

Organization: Ministry of Jal Shakti 

Department: Department of WR, RD & GR 

Category: Hardware 

Theme: Robotics and Drones 

The following methodology with the data is presented in this repository, the methods of classification and image capturing methods will be updated. The use of 3d visualization and predefined datasets to give AET and comprehending with water commands  

The design is uploaded for design considering a cost effective method of drone with minimum spending. 
minimum requirement for building and providing accurate result not hampering  available gis information.
